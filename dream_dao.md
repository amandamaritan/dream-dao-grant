**Name:** Dream DAO

**Brief Description:** Dream DAO trains and funds Gen Z to explore web3 and use it to make the world a better place.

**Relationship to EOS Network / Antelope: An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into the EOS Network or Antelope software.**

The path to getting everyone access to secure and transparent digital infrastructures depends on web3 adoption. This adoption demands that we educate people (especially diverse young people) and help them create solutions that increase the usage of web3 technologies.

At Civics Unplugged, we believe that the empowerment of the leaders of Generation Z to become civic innovators is critical to humanity and the planet’s flourishing. And we believe so much that web3 is critical to increasing human flourishing and making the world a better place that we launched the Dream DAO to provide the specialized training proven Gen Z leaders need to leverage web3 to do good in the world.
Gen Z and web3 are a match made in heaven. Gen Z, after all, is who will solve the challenges we face today and have to address the ones that are yet to emerge. And they are more than ready to disrupt entrenched power structures that fail the people they claim to serve.

We believe Gen Zers successfully leveraging web3 to do good in the world will inspire millions of skeptical people to champion and help build web3 in the coming years. This is where Dream DAO comes in.

Dream DAO is not related to EOS Network yet, and we want to change that. 

We genuinely believe that Dream DAO can contribute to growing the EOS Ecosystem and Community, by bringing more GenZ and Tech Students onto the Network.

While most projects being built at EOS are developing a product, we aim to seed a circle of young students and builders that, in the future, will implement and develop new systems and features that will scale the EOS Network portfolio. 

**Reason for Interest:** An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

**Answer:**

We believe that one of the best investments in humanity is Gen Z – the builders of the future. And, within Gen Z, we believe the highest leverage opportunity to realize their potential is to teach them how to leverage the most powerful emerging technology: web3.

The Dream DAO is the first organization to build a pipeline of Gen Z talent and to equip them to work effectively at the intersection of web3 and social impact. We aspire to attract the best young talent and to channel significant crypto capital to develop thousands of Gen Z civic innovators by 2030.

After all, Gen Z are the ones who will inherit the challenges we face today. They are also the ones who will need to address the challenges that have yet to emerge. We believe they are more than ready to start working on the solutions, disrupt entrenched power structures, and set empowering precedents for web3.

Web3’s ability to impact the world positively depends on the web3 builder community collectively looking a lot more like how the world looks like, and being more driven by social impact purpose.

Dream DAO will be a key driver in helping make this a reality.

Since its kickoff we have: 

- Partnered with Celo, NEAR, Coinbase, and Ethereum Foundation
- More than 5 in-person community events were hosted (NFT NYC, ETH DENVER, DEVCON VI, WEB3 CONF GOA, YALE MEET UP)
- We have onboarded 167 voting members, 109 builders, and 58 champions 
- More than 75 Learning Together sessions were hosted (conversational lectures). Some LTs, you can check:

**Project Details**

The Dream DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization building a web3 x social impact ecosystem for supporting Gen Z leaders to enter the web3 space.
The DAO is run primarily by Gen Zers aged 15-20 years (’Builders’) with mentorship from experienced professionals in web3 and social impact (’Champions’). Each semester (or as we call it: Season), we assemble small cohorts of exceptional Gen Zers from around the globe and give them community, education, mentorship, and internship opportunities, as well as experience running a DAO through decentralized governance. Our goal is to transform students into builders ready to leverage web3 to secure a brighter future for humanity.
We are helping build the web3 x social impact ecosystem by investing in three complementary areas of focus:

1. **Empowering learning community:** The Dream DAO cultivates an empowering, intergenerational, global community and offers a range of learning and mentorship opportunities that help young people gain knowledge, confidence, and experience at the intersection of web3 x social impact. The core “product” of the learning community is the “Learning Together” series, which is hosted twice a week and features a community member, or guest, hosting a lecture on a web3 concept and spreading the word on the Solarpunk future we envision will come with web3 x social impact. As an example, we are so proud to say that the Ethereum Foundation director Aya Miyaguchi hosted a Learning Together session with us (Click here to see the recording: https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Learning-Together-28-Ethereum-as-Infinite-Garden-Discovering-Your-Why-371fb1c929124d4588fa670615fc0caa?pvs=4).
Moreover, our new builders complete an intensive 3-week web3 ‘bootcamp’ run by their more experienced peers, allowing them to grasp key web3 basics and prepare to become contributors to the web3 ecosystem. Additionally, we organize a 1:1 mentorship program, where we match champions and Gen Z builders to help the latter learn and grow in their specific field of interest.

**2. Web3 x social impact Internship Program:** Our Internship Program is a two-month program called the Dream DAO Explorers Program. It is available for 15-20-year-olds seeking to be and build the future of web3 x social impact. The program started on June 2022 in which Dream DAO builders were placed in web3 organizations (e.g. Aera Force, Climate Collective, dORG, LOA Labs), and were able to experience their first job opportunity in web3.

You can learn more about the program here: https://www.notion.so/Dream-DAO-Explorers-Program-Internship-Host-One-Pager-228e991b62f1438bb7f587909803dd8c

**3. IRL Regen web3 gatherings**: We convene diverse, inspiring, regen-minded thinkers and builders to forge relationships and collaborations across the “regen web3” movement. In-person convenings, such as our trips to Devcon Bogotá and ETH Mexico, fill attendees with inspiration. This is why Dream DAO funds some of our community members to travel to, co-organize, and hack at such events.

We are not a software company, but we still embody the spirit of open source. Everything we do, we build in public and are a huge proponent of public documentation.

**Ecosystem Fit**

There are currently few to no educational providers focused on helping diverse 15-20-year-olds learn how to use web3 to do good in the world.

In different ecosystems, some similar ones are Builder DAO and otherwise similar communities for youth builders: TKS, Atlas, RISE, etc. With Builder DAO, there is no focus on social impact (plus it has shut down). The other communities focusing on youth builders and social impact, are selective in nature and require previous knowledge and expertise, and are often paid programs.

Dream DAO is free and encourages passionate people who have little knowledge about web3 to apply and learn about the space, and it operates as a DAO. Furthermore, Dream DAO is focused on blockchain and web3 for GenZ leaders (developers and non-tech) due to its potential to influence every single industry not only in a technical but also in an operational, hierarchal, and infrastructure way, and operating as a DAO is one way we show our commitment to this positive global transition.

Members of the Dream DAO will go on to build world-changing DAOs, create web3 x social impact projects that make unprecedented progress on entrenched social issues, and become moral and tech-savvy leaders of their respective industries. We owe it to our progeny to leave the world better than we found it. A web3 native institution that produces web3-powered civic superheroes is a public good if we've ever seen one.

 → The Dream DAO cultivates an empowering, intergenerational, global community and offers a range of learning + mentorship opportunities that help young people gain confidence and experience at the intersection of web3 x social impact.

Dream DAO Explorers Program (DDEP) is a two-month internship program for Dream DAO Builders who are looking to explore their interests in web3 and how web3 can be used to address social challenges. Participants do not have to be very tech-savvy but must be extremely committed to learning how to harness the power of decentralized systems to make a difference in the world.
So far, we’ve run 2 successful cohorts where 20+ Explorers have gained experience working across companies including Celo, Climate Collective, LOA Labs, dORG, Aera Force, and Protein. https://www.notion.so/cucrew/Dream-DAO-Explorers-Program-a2d1b501ac9e4375945b86bcffdec81a?pvs=4

Learning Together Sessions are the core product of the learning community of the Dream DAO. They are hosted twice a week and feature an experienced community member or guest hosting a lecture on a web3 concept. We are proud to have hosted over 80 sessions to date!

→ Past guest hosts include Gitcoin founder Kevin Owocki, Ethereum Foundation Executive Director Aya Miyaguchi, renowned web3 educator Samina, co-founder of Constitution DAO Graham Novak, and many more web3 luminaries.

Conference trips are also a key part of Dream DAO’s work, and we have sponsored builders to attend various conferences, including NFT NYC, web3 Conf Goa, and ETH Mexico since the DAO was launched.

In Mexico, our builders won prizes for their amazing accomplishments: Julia Staxx become an ETH Mexico Finalist — Saf, Dariel, Rebeca, and Arath — won Best Public Goods by Polygon, and Joshua won Best UX + User Onboarding. 

Check our recap here: http://youtube.com/watch?v=r603LXdSQjY 

In addition, 10 DAO members attended Devcon VI with Dream DAO in 2022, sharing their learnings and reflections from the conference here (https://www.notion.so/3d0bfe5b968c4200b4b8e3e02063cf32?pvs=21) to help spread the knowledge acquired from the trip further.

5. Dream DAO also frequently hosts Meet Ups which can provide a great way to enter and explore the web3 space. For example. in partnership with Celo we’ve hosted a meet-up at Yale University, introducing students and professors to web3 x social impact, Celo Org, and the Dream DAO.

**Future Plans**

We are working to improve the dynamics of the DAO learning environment by bringing more hands-on working experiences that will take place while our builders aren’t out in Conferences (sponsored by the DAO) or in Internships (from DD’s partnerships programs). 

Dream DAO plans to keep onboarding new builders (GenZ 15-20yo) to its community and initiating different opportunities to fund, train, and mentor these kids, so they keep growing and impacting the web3 ecosystem. 
In terms of financial plans, we have been sustainable from a combination of Ethereum NFT sales and charitable grant revenue.
Our 2 last rounds of NFT sales raised over $150,000. We plan to release more at the end of seasons 3 and 4, which will raise more money to fund the Dream DAO.
We are already getting a good amount of inbound from potential sponsors/funders of Dream DAO, but expect that it will pick up a lot once there are even more testimonials from prominent web3 organizations about just how valuable our Dream DAO Builders are to web3 organizations and to the web3 x social impact ecosystem at large. We’re already starting to see this in action as some of our original S1 and S2 builder interns have continued to work at their interning organizations, showing the DAO’s value in bringing emerging Gen Z talent into the web3 ecosystem.
